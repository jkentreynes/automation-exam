#Technologies Used
 - Protractor
 - Javascript

I chose to use these technologies since the web app is built in angular. Protractor is the recommended automation framework for webapps
built in angular. I chose javascript language since protractor is written javascript.


#Steps
run 'npm install -g protractor' command in terminal
run 'webdriver-manager start' command in terminal if there is an error run 'webdriver-manager update' command
go to the directory where this package is saved your current working directory should be under automation-exam/
run 'npm install' command in terminal
run 'protractor' command in terminal
